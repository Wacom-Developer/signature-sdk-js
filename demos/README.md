## Using the Signature SDK Sample Code

* copy the files *signature_sdk.js* and *signature_sdk.wasm* from the Signature SDK for JavaScript zip file into the folder */demos/common/libs/*
* create a folder called *digital-ink* within */sigCaptDialog/libs/will/*. 
* copy the folder from the downloaded WILL Ink SDK to the created above folder
    * */sigCaptDialog/libs/will/digital-ink*
* start a command prompt in the demos folder */demos/*
* use the command ```npm install``` to create the node_modules folder with all the dependencies

The web based app needs a web server.
Python's `SimpleHTTPServer` provides an easy way to get started.
To start the web server, start a command prompt in the project root folder and run:

```
# Python 2:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

# Python 3:
python -m http.server 8080
```

Now you can access the web-demos via:

```http://localhost:8080/index.html```
